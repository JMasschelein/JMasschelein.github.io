title: My goals as a Front-end developer
---

Did you ever had the feeling you wanted to change your life because you want to follow your passion ? I was having this 
experience while working as a Client Success agent at an online marketing company. I saw developers building the most amazing 
applications but more importantly following their passion. 

I am passionated by technology changing the customer experience landscape. In order to acheive my goal, I realised that I had 
to reorientate myself for obtaining the necessary coding knowledge. Because of this, I started the Bloc Webdevelopment program.
This course guides you through the theory accompanied by a mentor. On a weekly base or twice a week, you meet up with an 
industry professional by Google Hangout or Skype. He / she answers all your questions for making sure you obtain the wright k
knowledge.

Is the program a guarantee for success ? I am convinced what is learned through the program is very uself looking for your first
gig. However, I am also convinced it will also be up to me to prove myself as this an always changing industry. Feel free to 
contact me if you want to chat when you consider starting with a webdevelopment program.
