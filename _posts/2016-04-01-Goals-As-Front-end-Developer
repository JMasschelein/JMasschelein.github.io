title: My goals as Front-end developer
---

As told in previous post, I am fascinated by the online customer experience. An online purchase is determined by the level of
the online customer experience. Think for instance about purchasing a product on Amazon or booking a flight. This experience
reflects the company branding. 

My goal is to help implementing good experiences through clients' websites. The growth of these company's online sales and / or
engagement is what gives me satisfaction. An example is for instance showing your comapany's offer in a clean and appealing way.
Website visitors need to be convinced of your offer's quality before contacting you or purchase the product online. There is
limited time to convince the visitor. This means the design and technical features have to be optimized for convincing the 
visitor. 

I personally would not purchase a product online when the offer is not clear. Not just offer but also the navigation for finding 
information. A potential client will leave the website from the moment something is not clear. People looking for products are
comparing different offers and will utlimately chose for "the winner". As important, when a client buys a similar product he will
visit the website first where he purchased the product the most recently. This means that even though not winning the visitor's
trust when visiting for the first time, he will also not come back when purchasing a product with your competitor. 

What does this mean for me ? Implementing the best online customer experience keeping the company's strategy in mind. I am happy 
to share my thoughts on how to approach this.
